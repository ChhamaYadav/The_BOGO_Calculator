The Big Diwali Sale: BOGO Offer
For the upcoming Diwali sale, we have a &quot;Buy One Get One Free&quot; (BOGO)
campaign. Here’s a simple explanation of how it works and how customers can
maximize their discounts.
Offer Rules:
1. Customers can buy any number of products.
2. When a customer buys one product, they can get another product for free.
3. The free product must be of equal or lesser value than the one purchased.
Customer Objective:
 Customers should pair items to maximize their discount. This means selecting
the most expensive eligible items as the free ones.
